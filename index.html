                    <p>It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to my Internet blog thing, where I am sharing my boardgame inserts as well as general advice and best practices on how to properly fight zipbags (or other similar atrocities) when it comes to game components organization.</p>
                    <p>Whether a boardgame is loved, sees the table every now and then, or is just a shelved dust collector, it shouldn't endure containing a bunch of zipbags mushed together.</p>
                    <p>There must be a better way, without breaking the bank, and actually, there is!</p>

                    <p>This is one of those games that I bought even though BGG slammed it into the ground (at the time of writing this post: ranked 6706/22000 (lower is better), and 6.2/10 rating (higher is better)), and user comments and ratings reflected this.</p>
                    <p>I found the graphics cute and totally fell in love with the triple dice tower. Also, the wall placement seemed like a nice novelty.</p>
                    <p>Waited for the price to drop, before I pulled the trigger, just in case it flops, so that I don't lose too much money.</p>
                    <p>I was surprised to find that it's actually a pretty decent game!</p>
                    <p>It has seen our table a couple of times, and it earned its place on the shelf. It's a great candidate to play with people that are just getting into boardgaming!</p>
                    <p>There are not that many elements to be organized, so this time it's a matter of designing a "micro" insert, so it should be done fast.</p>
                    <p>Will keep you posted!</p>

                 <p><i>How appropriate!</i></p>
                 <p>Sheepland is a fantastic game that manages to properly incapsulate a simple yet effective mechanic.</p>
                    <p>There are a bunch of sheep on the board, and in your turn, you move your shepherd and/or move sheep from one region to another. The goal is to gather as many sheep as possible, in the regions you invested money in.</p>
                    <p>I personally adore these types of games because it requires litte time to learn, and can always be brought to the table, no matter the skills of the people around it.
                </p><p>I finished the insert, but I admit I struggled a bit with the design, as I insisted on keeping the original cardboard insert inside and wanted to enrich it with foamboard.
