                    <p>It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to my Internet blog thing, where I am sharing my boardgame inserts as well as general advice and best practices on how to properly fight zipbags (or other similar atrocities) when it comes to game components organization.</p>
                    <p>Whether a boardgame is loved, sees the table every now and then, or is just a shelved dust collector, it shouldn't endure containing a bunch of zipbags mushed together.</p>
                    <p>There must be a better way, without breaking the bank, and actually, there is!</p>

                        </p><p>Designers: Friedemann Friese
                        </p><p>Artist: Lars-Arne "Maura" Kalusky
                        </p><p>Publisher: Ideal Board Games
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>I admit that I rely a bit too much on the artwork and box size of a board game. I know this is not ideal, I have been burned quite a couple times because of this - I bought bad games that had big boxes and/or had great art and the other way around.</p>
                    <p>Friese's Landlord is one of the latter - the box artwork pushed me away several times when I wanted to buy it, and the size of the box felt discouraging. Some days ago I decided to ignore these shallow arguments and go for it!</p>
                    <p>It was a great decision! The game is fantastic!</p>
                    <p>Funny enough, the box is actually smaller than I expected but boy does it pack a punch.</p>
                    <p>You see, in Landlord, you try to maximize the profit from tennants living in your buildings while trying to defend and straight up go beserk on your oponents.</p>
                    <p>I found the game to be quite aggressive! The rules are a bit of a handful but I am sure that after 2-3 more plays (which will totally happen) we will get the hang of it!</p>
                    <p>Also, if my guesstimates are correct, I should be able to design a mini insert for it! It actually needs one, although I admit that I want to challenge myself with designing and building such a small insert!</p>

                    <p>I never understood the following bit in the rulebook, concerning the special rules for 2-player game:</p>
                    <p><i>Each player uses 2 Shepherds (<b>use only the red and blue Shepherds</b>).</i></p>
                    <p>For context, the game can be played with up to 4 players, each getting one Shepherd (red, blue, green or yellow). There are a total of 6 Shepherds in the box, red and blue being the only color with two Shepherds.</p>
                    <p>Now, I now it's superficial and shallow but it would be a nice touch to allow people to choose green or yellow, when only 2 people are playing.</p>
                    <p>I guess it was a measure to cut costs but honestly I would've still bought the game had it been couple cents more expensive.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, the fix was easy, to be honest, thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.magazinuldesah.ro/accesorii-table-backgammon/https-www-magazinuldesah-ro-pioni-pentru-jocuri-set-4-bucati-galben-html.html">a product I found on MagazinulDeSah.</a></p>
                    <p>It's my pleasure to introduce <b>The Shepherdess</b>!</p>
                    <p>She is used in 2 player games, and helps the Shepherd with his duties. Actually, she functions as complete equal of the Shepherd, as stated in the official rules.</p>
                    <p>The difference is that now players have the options to choose other colors than red and blue.</p>

                    <p>The artwork of Calico totally got me hooked and after finding out that it has a fantastic ranking on BGG (at the time of writing this post, it was ranked 175, with a rating of 7.7) I bought it instantly.</p>
                    <p>The best thing about this game is that it's about cats!</p>
                    <p>Ok, the second best thing about the game is it's simple to learn/hard to master mechanics and how tight they are designed.</p>
                    <p>We played it multiple times, both with people that had experience with board games as well as people that had less.</p>
                    <p>The insert was a bit tricky to design and although there are only a few components, it required a bit of back and forth and backtracking all the way to the drawing board. Fortunately it's finished!</p>

                    <p>This is one of those games that I bought even though BGG slammed it into the ground (at the time of writing this post: ranked 6706/22000 (lower is better), and 6.2/10 rating (higher is better)), and user comments and ratings reflected this.</p>
                    <p>I found the graphics cute and totally fell in love with the triple dice tower. Also, the wall placement seemed like a nice novelty.</p>
                    <p>Waited for the price to drop, before I pulled the trigger, just in case it flops, so that I don't lose too much money.</p>
                    <p>I was surprised to find that it's actually a pretty decent game!</p>
                    <p>It has seen our table a couple of times, and it earned its place on the shelf. It's a great candidate to play with people that are just getting into boardgaming!</p>
                    <p>There are not that many elements to be organized, so this time it's a matter of designing a "micro" insert, so it should be done fast.</p>

                 <p><i>How appropriate!</i></p>
                 <p>Sheepland is a fantastic game that manages to properly incapsulate a simple yet effective mechanic.</p>
                    <p>There are a bunch of sheep on the board, and in your turn, you move your shepherd and/or move sheep from one region to another. The goal is to gather as many sheep as possible, in the regions you invested money in.</p>
                    <p>I personally adore these types of games because it requires litte time to learn, and can always be brought to the table, no matter the skills of the people around it.
                </p><p>I finished the insert, but I admit I struggled a bit with the design, as I insisted on keeping the original cardboard insert inside and wanted to enrich it with foamboard.
